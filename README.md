## Installation

### Using Git and the install script

The repository is made for use inside your `$HOME` directory. It will ignore everything other than what it explicitly is tracking already.

``` bash
cd $HOME
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:hkdobrev/dotfiles.git
git fetch origin master
git reset --hard origin/master
```

It is recommended to fork the repo and adjust it as needed.

#### Installing initial tools

When setting up a new computer use the `install.sh` script to install Homebrew, Homebrew budle, rbenv, vim-plug, Composer, set up Bash 4 and the XCode CLI tools.

``` bash
./install.sh
```

# Updating

To later update the dotfiles configuration:

```bash
cd $HOME
git pull
```

To update your software run the `update` command which will update Ruby gems, Homebrew formulae, Composer globals and others.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/hkdobrev/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Mathias Bynens"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --file=$HOME/.gitconfig.extra user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mathias@mailinator.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --file=$HOME/.gitconfig.extra user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/hkdobrev/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae and Cask apps

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
```
